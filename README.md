# Anomaly Detection

## description

a prediction maintainence application using artificial intelligence.
A ML end-to-end solution in detecting anomalous ball bearing(s) of a machine that collects sensor readings. A faulty or fast wearing of ball bearing is the major cause of breakdown of a mechanical machine. We sought to detect it in advance, so that quick replacements can be made. 

Language used : python<br>
Libraries : pycaret<br>
